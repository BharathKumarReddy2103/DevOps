# 🚀 Build in Public: The DevOps Visibility Strategy You Need in 2025

> ✨ *“Be so visible, they can’t ignore you.”* — Bharath Kumar Reddy

## 📘 Overview

In today’s fast-paced DevOps and Cloud landscape, technical skills alone are not enough to stand out. What sets professionals apart in 2025 is **visibility**—how consistently you show your work, share your knowledge, and build your personal brand online.

This README is your actionable guide to creating opportunities using free platforms like **GitHub**, **LinkedIn**, and **Twitter (X)**.

## 📢 Why Visibility Matters in 2025

Gone are the days when a resume and cold outreach were enough to land a job. Hiring today is more **public** and **community-driven**.

✅ GitHub = Your hands-on portfolio  
✅ LinkedIn = Your professional voice  
✅ Twitter (X) = Your micro-credibility builder

If you don’t show your work, someone else will.  
If you don’t build in public, someone else is already doing it.  
**Recruiters and opportunities aren’t waiting.**

## 🔧 If I Were Starting My Career in 2025...

Here’s a realistic visibility-building strategy I would follow as a fresher or career switcher:

### 🔢 Weekly Action Plan

1. ✍️ Post **3×** a week on **LinkedIn**  
2. 🐦 Repurpose those posts into **6× short tweets**  
3. 💻 Push **1 hands-on project every 2 weeks** to **GitHub**
