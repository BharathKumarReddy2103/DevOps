## 📌 The Harsh Truth: Courses Alone Don’t Get You Jobs

Over the last couple of years, I've been asked countless times:

* “How do I enter IT?”
* “I want a high package but with low effort.”
* “Which is the easiest technology?”
* “Will this field have long-term career growth?”

Maybe 5–10 years ago, such expectations could work. But **in the last 2–3 years**, the landscape has changed. Employers today are looking for **skilled engineers**—not just certificate holders.

> 💡 **Reality Check:**
> Joining a course is **only the beginning**, not the guarantee of a job.
