**Creating and Automating Virtual Machines in Cloud:**

Virtual machines (VMs) are a foundational building block in the world of DevOps and cloud computing. In this article, we’ll dive deep into how VMs are created and managed across major cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure, as well as on on-premise infrastructures. We’ll also explore automation techniques using AWS CLI, APIs, CloudFormation, CDK, and Terraform, making this article valuable for DevOps engineers aiming for efficient infrastructure management.

**Introduction**

In a modern DevOps landscape, the ability to provision and manage virtual machines efficiently is critical. Whether you're working on AWS, Azure, or an on-premise setup, the principles remain the same—but the tools and automation approaches may differ. This guide aims to give you a practical understanding of creating VMs manually through cloud consoles and automating VM provisioning through DevOps best practices.

**Creating Virtual Machines via Cloud Consoles**

Let’s begin with the traditional, manual approach of creating VMs using cloud provider consoles.

**AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

To create an EC2 instance manually:

1.	Visit AWS Console.
2.	Sign in or create a new account.
3.	Navigate to EC2 service → Launch Instance.
4.	Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) like Ubuntu.
5.	Select a free-tier eligible instance type (e.g., t2.micro).
6.	Create a key pair (for SSH access).
7.	Launch the instance and note the public IP.

```sh
# Example command to SSH into your instance
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ubuntu@<PUBLIC-IP>
```

**Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines**

To create a VM in Azure:

1.	Go to Azure Portal.
2.	Sign in or register using GitHub or email.
3.	Navigate to "Virtual Machines" → Create.
4.	Fill in the required specs (image, instance size, region).
5.	Launch the VM and note the public IP.

**On-Premise Virtual Machine Creation**

For organizations not yet migrated to the cloud:

•	Use tools like **VMware vSphere, VirtualBox**, or **KVM**.

•	Create a VM by allocating CPU, memory, and disk space.

•	Install your preferred OS and configure networking.

•	This is typically managed by system administrators.

**The Need for Automation in DevOps**

While UI-based VM creation works for one-off tasks, DevOps emphasizes **efficiency and repeatability**. Imagine receiving hundreds of VM requests daily—manual creation becomes a bottleneck.

Automation helps by:

•	Eliminating human error

•	Ensuring consistency

•	Saving time

•	Supporting CI/CD workflows

**Automation Options in AWS**

AWS offers multiple tools and services to automate VM creation. All of them ultimately interact with the **AWS EC2 API**.

**1. AWS CLI**

Command-line tool for interacting with AWS services.

```sh
# Launch an EC2 instance using CLI
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
  --key-name my-key \
  --security-groups my-sg
```

**2. AWS EC2 API**

Direct API calls to provision EC2 instances. Requires signing requests and sending payloads in JSON.

Useful for custom applications or integrations.

**3. Boto3 (Python SDK)**

Python SDK for AWS. Great for scripting and automation.

```sh
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
instance = ec2.create_instances(
    ImageId='ami-0abcdef1234567890',
    InstanceType='t2.micro',
    MinCount=1,
    MaxCount=1,
    KeyName='my-key'
)
```

**4. AWS CloudFormation (CFT)**

Define infrastructure as code using YAML/JSON.

```sh
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      ImageId: "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
      InstanceType: "t2.micro"
      KeyName: "my-key"
```

**5. AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**

Write infrastructure as code using TypeScript, Python, or Java.

```sh
from aws_cdk import (
    aws_ec2 as ec2,
    core,
)

class MyEC2Stack(core.Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)
        ec2.Instance(self, "MyInstance",
            instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t2.micro"),
            machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux(),
            vpc=vpc
        )
```

**Multi-Cloud Automation with Terraform**

**Terraform** is a cloud-agnostic tool by HashiCorp that supports AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.

```sh
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"
}
```

•	Ideal for hybrid or multi-cloud strategies.

•	Reusable modules for consistent infrastructure provisioning.

**When to Use What: Choosing the Right Tool**

| Scenario                  | Recommended Tool           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| AWS-only, beginner        | AWS CLI or CloudFormation  |
| AWS-only, advanced        | AWS CDK                    |
| Multi-cloud/hybrid        | Terraform                  |
| Python expertise          | Boto3                      |
| Custom UI/backend integration | AWS EC2 API           |

**Note**: Always align your tool choice with your team’s skills, project requirements, and cloud strategy.

**Conclusion**

As a DevOps Engineer, mastering virtual machine provisioning—both manually and through automation—is vital. Start with hands-on practice via the cloud console and gradually adopt automation tools like AWS CLI, CDK, and Terraform. The more you automate, the more efficient and reliable your infrastructure becomes.
